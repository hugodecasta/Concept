### The goal of this project is to offer a way to graphically manipulate concpet, notes keywords. This project comes from the will to facilitated note taking will lectures or to help prepare a state of the art.

---
## Basic ideas
Multiple notes can be taken and will be classified in type.
Pre-list of types:
 * Keywords
 * Concept
 * Notes
 * Foundings

(boolMaster will be used to store data)
The system can found recurrent keywords and propose to look for them more in detail.

One great thing to do is not only link keyword litterals to their concepts but also be able to link elements between them maybe with properties (like oriented). It would be good also to be able to see the concrete links.
