### The goal of this project is to offer a way to graphically manipulate concpet, notes keywords. This project comes from the will to facilitated note taking will lectures or to help prepare a state of the art.

## Basic ideas
Multiple notes can be taken and will be classified in type.
Pre-list of types:
 * Keywords
 * Concept
 * Notes
 * Foundings

(boolMaster will be used to store data)
The system can found recurrent keywords and propose to look for them more in detail.

One great thing to do is not only link keyword litterals to their concepts but also be able to link elements between them maybe with properties (like oriented). It would be good also to be able to see the concrete links.

This is now done by 
 * default when a keyword as the same name of a pre-existing concept or by
 * giving the name of a pre-existing concept while conceptualizing a keyword (the keyword text will be associated to this concept in the future and forever)

---
## New ideas about associations
 * Show links between concepts or create visual cluster automaticaly `[ TODO ]`

Using canvas one could show the links between concepts. It would be good too to propose a concepts placement in space based on this linking. It would be good to be able to see the importance of concepts based on their links.

 * Create story telling system `[ TODO ]`

One good idea would be to create a story telling system with which one can follow the concept path by pressing ctrl and go forward with the telling. Each time one press the ctrl key it jump to the "next" concept from a pre-determined list. This list could be created by a simple algo making it retrieavable on the flight every time.

 * Change from info to keyword and vice-verso `[ DONE ]`

Would be cool to use one key to change an item from keyword list to infos list and vice-versa. And/or to copy to the other list

One can now move info to keyword and vice-verso by using the "m" key (as move)

 * A quick one-time tutorial `[ DONE ]`

Create a simple visual tutoriel telling the user which key to press for what reason. Maybe create an alternate git project ... !

The project is now uses the "helpme" submodule allowing to create a tutorial for begginners
